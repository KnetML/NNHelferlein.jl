# NNHelferlein.jl
Collection of little helpers to simplify various Machine Learning tasks
(esp. building neural networks with Knet).

The German word *Helferlein* means something like *little helper*;
please pronounce it like `en-en-hell-fur-line`.

# Caveat:
Please be aware that the package is still in development and
not yet tested. You may already use it on own risk.

As soon as dev. and tests are completed the package will be
registered (however maybe under a different name).
