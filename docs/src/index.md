# NNHelferlein - ADo's Neural Networks Little Helpers

The package provides helpers and utilities mainly to be
used with the Knet package to build artificial neural networks.

The package follows mainly the Knet-style; i.e. all networks can be
trained with the Knet-iterators, all layers can be used together with
Knet-style *quickly-self-written* layers, all Knet-networks can be trained
with tb_train(), all data providers can be used together, ...
